# SST (Speech To speech Translator)

This is my first project utilizing Tkinter, Microsofts Speech/Translate API, and gTTS.

## Requirements

Python 3.6 -> 3.9

### Packages:

requests - ```pip install requests```

The application is quite simple to navigate.

Simply, select the language you speak and the language you want to translate to.

Then, press the button and speak.

The program will translate your speech and play the translated speech!
